# MUVP-CollegeApp

<h2>Mission</h2>
The mission of the College App is to allow the user to efficiently browse and sort through the colleges within the United States and allow them the tools to do further research on the institutions website. Far too often this process is complicated by decision paralysis of too many options and no quick way to narrow them down. We aim to put the answer at the users finger tips.


<h2>About</h2>
This application is created to aid anyone in the process of selecting a college. We will do this by providing a convenient and accessible user interface where a user can swipe     left or right to determine if they want to skip the college or review the college in more detail. We will provide pictures of the college, links to the website, a link to a       tuition cost tool provided by the institution, statistics from the college, etc. Users will be able to create an account so that they have the ability to go explore the colleges   that they selected to review previously. Users should have the ability to post comments about colleges.
